Today I've been exploring different tools for my freedom project from the [Freedom Project Tool list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/edit).
I explored two of the Freedom Project tools from the list that may help me with my freedom project, which are [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I have been defining my problem (finding and exploring tools) and researching what each tool works and how it can apply to my project. First, I defined my problem, which is finding Freedom project tools that can apply to my freedom project. Then I research each FP tool (firebase) to see if it would apply to my project. I learn that Firebase is storage that helps the user to keep their information. Google doc sets an example of Firebase, where the user would type their information and being storage for them to go back. Firebase helps the user refresh the page, and the information would still be there without being removed.

I have decided to use Firebase for my freedom project. My freedom project is going to be a combination of a to-do list (main focus) and a timer. Since my focus right now is creating a to-do list, Firebase helps me store my users' to-do list, so they can come back to (or refresh) the page whenever they want to cross out a task they have completed or adding more tasks to the list. I think making a to-do list (and a timer on the side) can help everyone. Students can use it as a way to study and keep up with their tasks while having a study timer to track time. Adults can use it with the cooking and ingredients list. They can use the to-do list to track their grocery list, step by step ingredients list, and timer to time their cooking time.

The skills I used are consideration and How to google. The reason for using skill consideration is that I have to consider if my project is going to help others and myself. I think itâ€™s important to know that how to creates my project, and how it will impact others and make people manage their tasks/time properly after using my project. How to google is another thing that connects to consideration. After considering my topic will impact and give people ideas, I have to research different tools and information to create my project.  My skill in how to google has helped me learn the basic idea or tutorials for my project.  I think consideration and How to google, as my first two steps, have to help me know what to expect and use for my future steps in the process of making this project.

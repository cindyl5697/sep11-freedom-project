Today I've been exploring different tools for my freedom project from the class list (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/edit).
As I explore each of the tools that may help me with my freedom project, in the end, I have decided to choose between ReactJS (https://reactjs.org)  and Firebase (https://firebase.google.com).

Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I have been exploring and researching what each tool works and how it can apply to my project. I first define my problem, which is finding Freedom project tools to apply to my freedom project. Then I research each FP tool to see if it would apply to my project. I learn that Firebase is storage that helps the user to keep their information. Google doc sets an example of Firebase where the user would type their information and being storage for them to go back. Firebase helps the user refresh the page, and the information would still be there without being removed.

I have decided to use Firebase for my freedom project. My freedom project is going to be a combination of a to-do list and a timer. Since my focus right now is creating a to-do list, Firebase helps me store my users' to-do list, so they can come back to the page whenever they want to cross out a task they have completed or adding more tasks to the list.

The skills I used are consideration and How to google. The reason for using skill consideration is that I have to consider if my project is going to help others and myself. I think itâ€™s important to know that how to creates my project, and how it will impact others and give people ideas after using my project. How to google is another thing that connects to consideration. After considering my topic will impact and give people ideas, I have to research different tools and information to create my project.  My skill in how to google helps me learn the tutorial of the project to have a basic idea for my project.  I think consideration and How to google, as my first two steps, have to help me know what to expect and use for my future steps in the process of making this project.

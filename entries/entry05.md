In this freedom project, my partner and I are in the process of finishing our Freedom Project, TODO List using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). We decided to use [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) for our project. We are following this [youtube video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-gIPGzmK4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB) that help us incorporate our code to Firebase. 

_________________

In this Engineering Design Process, I am in the steps of "Test and evaluate the prototype", "Improve as needed", and "Communicate the results". Cloud Firestore is our fitted database to collect and store the task inputs. As I previous mention, Firestore allows user to collect and store their data in the cloud. It helps my freedom project "TO-DO LIST" because the user's task will automatically stored to the system. We (Nina and I) already created the base of Javascript. We also incoperate Firebase into our code by following youtube video playlist.  Throughout our process of finishing the Javascript and incoperate firebase, we encounter many errors. As we connect our code into firebase, we have difficulties making our task button save/delete the task in the beginning. After doing many error trials, we finally got to make our code connect to firebase. As we finish the code, I also communicate with my partner, Nina, to improve our TODO List. Since time run short, we decided to make a simple TODO List with simple design.

I am using **Firebase** for my freedom project as my final freedom project tool. This time, I am creating a firebase code that allows me to incoperate fireabase into my project and store user's input more efficiently.
